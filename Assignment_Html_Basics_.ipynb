        "3.  **`<head>`**: This section contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as the title of the page (displayed in the browser tab), links to stylesheets (CSS), and scripts (JavaScript). This information is not directly visible to the user on the page itself.\n",
        "4.  **`<title>`**: This element, located within the `<head>`, sets the title of the HTML page.\n",

        "*   **Accessibility:** A well-structured HTML page is more accessible to users with disabilities who rely on assistive technologies like screen readers. The structure provides a logical order for the content, making it easier for these technologies to interpret and convey information.\n",
